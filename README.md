Notebooks to reproduce the results of the study "**Modeling the Effects of Aridification on Hydrologic Fluxes and Reservoir Dynamics in the U.S. Southwest**". This study employs the Community Land Model (CLM5) to examine changes in hydrologic fluxes due to a shift toward aridity and the extent to which water storage in major reservoirs has offset these changes.
